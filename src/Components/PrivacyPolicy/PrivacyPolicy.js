          <p>
            You have to provide us with personal information like your name, contact no, mailing address and email id,
            our app will also fetch your location information in order to give you the best service. Like many other
            websites, we may record information that your web browser routinely shares, such as your browser type,
            browser language, software and hardware attributes, the date and time of your visit, the web page from which
            you came, your Internet Protocol address and the geographic location associated with that address, the pages
            on this Site that you visit and the time you spent on those pages. This will generally be anonymous data
            that we collect on an aggregate basis. We may also use Google Analytics or a similar service to gather
            statistical information about the visitors to this Site and how they use the Site. This, also, is done on an
            anonymous basis. We will not try to associate anonymous data with your personally identifiable data. If you

            If you want to use our service you must create an account on our Site. To establish your account, we will
            ask for personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, which may include
            your name, phone number, and e-mail address. We may also collect demographic information about you, such as

          </p>

          <p>
            Other than basic information that we need to establish your account, it will be up to you to decide how much
            information to share as part of your profile. We encourage you to think carefully about the information that
            you share and we recommend that you guard your identity and your sensitive information. Of course, you can
            review and revise your profile at any time.&nbsp;

            If you have created an account, we will also use persistent cookies that remain on your computer’s
